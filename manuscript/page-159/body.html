Thus, these four lines, in her mouth, were madly gay,—</p><p><em>Un cofre de gran riqueza Hallaron dentro un pilar, Dentro del, nuevas banderas Con figuras de espantar</em>.</p><p>A coffer of great richness In a pillar’s heart they found, Within it lay new banners, With figures to astound.</p><p>And an instant afterwards, at the accents which she imparted to this stanza,—</p><p><em>Alarabes de cavallo Sin poderse menear, Con espadas, y los cuellos, Ballestas de buen echar</em>,</p><p>Gringoire felt the tears start to his eyes. Nevertheless, her song breathed joy, most of all, and she seemed to sing like a bird, from serenity and heedlessness.</p></div> </div>
