You change the conversation very abruptly.”</p><p>“Was she not your wife?”</p><p>“Yes, by virtue of a broken crock. We were to have four years of it. By the way,” added Gringoire, looking at the archdeacon in a half bantering way, “are you still thinking of her?”</p><p>“And you think of her no longer?”</p><p>“Very little. I have so many things. Good heavens, how pretty that little goat was!”</p><p>“Had she not saved your life?”</p><p>“‘Tis true, pardieu!”</p><p>“Well, what has become of her? What have you done with her?”</p><p>“I cannot tell you. I believe that they have hanged her.”</p></div> </div>
