He resumed his dainty, caressing air.</p><p>“Stay, dear Brother Claude, I should not come to you, with any evil motive. There is no intention of cutting a dash in the taverns with your unzains, and of strutting about the streets of Paris in a caparison of gold brocade, with a lackey, <em>cum meo laquasio</em>.

It is a charity. It will cost three forms, and I should like to contribute to it.”</p><p>“What are names of your two friends?”</p><p>“Pierre l’Assommeur and Baptiste Croque-Oison .”</p><p>Peter the Slaughterer; and Baptist Crack-Gosling.</p></div> </div>
