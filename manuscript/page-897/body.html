Sow hemp, not wheat, from Issy to Vanvre. The thief hath not stolen the beautiful hempen rope. Grumble, Grève, bark, Grève!

That spectacle was as good as any other.</p><p>He saw Jehan go to a window at the end of the room, open it, cast a glance on the quay, where in the distance blazed a thousand lighted casements, and he heard him say as he closed the sash,—</p><p>“‘Pon my soul! How dark it is; the people are lighting their candles, and the good God his stars.”</p></div> </div>
